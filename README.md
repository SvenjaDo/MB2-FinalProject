# MB2-FinalProject

This code was written for the final submission of the course: 'Introduction to programming and statistics for remote sensing and GIS' (04-GEO-MB2) for the EAGLE master at the university of WÃ¼rzburg in April 2022.\\

Land cover change due to coal mining in the Adoro coal mine, Borneo, Indonesia is analysed using three MODIS scenes from 2002, 2011 and 2021 with a resolution of 500m.
The extent of the mine for each year is determined with an unsupervised classification using the 'Hartigan-Wong' algorithm applied on calculated indices NDVI, NDWI and BSI. \\
Changes between these years are detected with both, a postclassification unsing the classification results as well as a change vector analysis applied on calculated tasseled cap tranformation (brighness and greeness of the scenes). \\
The results will be visualized with the ggplot package and animated .gif files.
